Duck
Lake
Oh, hello! I thought I saw someone over in the fields. I am always glad to have company by the lake, especially with this splendid weather.
If you wouldn't mind, I actually am trying to forage for art supplies. If you could help me collect some flowers and a bowl, I can make you something really special!
"Thank you, that's everything I needed. With what both of us collected, I was able to make every color of the rainbow in paste form! Feel free to take as much as you want, I made more than enough for the two of us!
That's all I have for now, good luck with your project!

Come to appreciate my fortress, have you? I don't blame you. It's not every day that you get to see such craftsmanship do you?
It's not just the steel either. I have enough supplies to last the rest of my life. You couldn't besiege me if you wanted to!
Here, I'll give you a sample of some of my stock. It's as delicious as it is preservable.
I appreciate your interest, but I have to go. My supply won't defend itself you know.
Bee
Tree top
I have been surprised to have visitors lately, I hope that the others didn't leave you with a certain impression of how we are, especially that squirrel...
Regardless, you did seem drawn to my abode. Did you come here appreciate the lighting and the carpeting? I am trying to separate myself from the others that dwell below.
By coming here You seem to have better taste than the others around here. Take this, I have a feeling you're the only one other than me who could really appreciate it.
Leave me. I have more productive things to do with my time than talk to you.
