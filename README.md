<h1>Founded In Cedar</h1>
<h2>By Kate Brooks and Blake Chandler</h2>

We made a short (unfinished, currently) text adventure game which involves picking up ingredients in order to, at the end, make a dish to share with the friends you've made.

Written entirely in Java.

Right now, it only runs in the terminal, though I'd like to look into getting it its own window.
Also, NPC interaction doesn't work yet which is... a major thing.
