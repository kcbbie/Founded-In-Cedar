<h1>Founded In Cedar</h1>
By Kate Brooks and Blake Chandler

<h3> Description </h3>
We made a short (unfinished, currently) text adventure game which involves picking up ingredients in order to, at the end, make a dish to share with the friends you've made.

Written entirely in Java.

<h3> How to run it </h3>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure you have an IDE (such as jGRASP or VS Code) and the JDK installed. You can find instructions to download+install jGRASP and the JDK <a href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse14x/software2-openJDK/">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Download the program. You can do this by clicking the green "Code" button, which is above the list of files, and under the bar with all the tabs (settings, actions, projects, etc). Select "Download ZIP" to download the ZIP file.</li>
  <li>Open the main file, "FoundedInCedar.java", in your IDE.</li>
  <li>Run the java file. In some IDEs, you may need to compile it before you can run it. In jGRASP, you can compile a file by hitting the green plus icon towards the top of the window. Once this is done, hit the button with the running man icon to run it (this button is to the right of the green plus).</li>
  <li>Success!</li>
</ol>
  
<h3> Issues </h3>
Right now, it only runs in the terminal, though we'd like to look into getting it its own window.

NPC interaction doesn't work yet which is... a major thing. You need it in order to complete the game. (We have written the dialogue that will be used though. You can find that in the 'globals' folder.)
  
The game is sort of just a walking and taking simulator at this point.
